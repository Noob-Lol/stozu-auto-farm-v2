# Stozu auto farm
Automated credit farm on [stozu](https://dash.stozu.net/), speed is ~5 per minute, per instance. 

Made on Python with Selenium WebDriver.

**This is Adsense version as Linkvertise got nuked. XD**
## Update info:
- Switched to regular Chrome, as I implemented everything without the need for a profile.
- Unlimited speed*
> [!TIP]
> *You can open multiple cmd windows and run the sript in each, this will multiply the speed.
>
> 10x should earn about 50 credits per minute. The maximum speed is limited by your CPU. 
- No more cloudflare, i added a proxy.
> [!WARNING]  
> Do NOT misuse or overload the proxy! I will shutdown it if someone does.
>
> You can only access stozu.net websites with proxy. Your IP's are logged, but I don't save them.
